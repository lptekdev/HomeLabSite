        <p><b>Purpose and context:</b> <br>            
            Like "every IT nerd" guy (and not only IT), we encourage ourselves to build and deploy a Home Lab where we can explore, test and develop things. 
            Depending on each one of us, each Home Lab has certain specifications and characteristics, providing also different kind of services belonging to different categories.
            My Home Lab is more focused in infrastructure services, and I use it to understand better network, storage and compute. 
            It is served by one Proxmox server, installed also with a SDN (Software Defined Network) package, that allows me to scale more at the network level (beyond the VLANs limitations). 
            At this time, I only use local attached storage, suported by a nvme disk. 
            I setup this environment, with the help a VyOS router (Router1) and a Pfsense firewall, to behave like a multi-tenant environment, where I can use duplicated IP address space and a perimeter firewall for internet access. 
            A description and an image of this setup are below. <br>
            <p>
                
            </p>

            Each tenant has its own address space (by default: 10.0.0.0/16) and is isolated by a Zone (configured in the Proxmox SDN). Tenant VNETs are created based on the workloads requirements and belongs to only one Zone. 
            Configuring a Zone creates a VRF in Proxmox server. <br>
            Since the VyOS Router1 supports EVPN, it can act as a peer together with the Proxmox server. 
            In the Router1 must be configured a VXLAN interface for each tenant with the same ID as the tenant Zone, and a pseudo-interface that will connect to the upstream perimeter firewall. 
            Pseudo interfaces in VyOS allows "slice" the same physical interface and configure an IP address and a VLAN ID (that identify each tenant). <br>
            Besides this, a default static route via the firewall is configured in Router1 and also advertised by BGP to the Tenant VRF in the Proxmox server. <br>
            <p>

            </p>
            Each tenant has a dedicated perimeter firewall, which already mentioned is Pfsense. The perimeter firewall allows the tenant to configure north-south firewall rules, IPSec tunnels and NAT for internet access (besides other features).<br>
            In the routing configuration, the firewall has configured a route to the Tenant address space through the gateway IP: 172.16.0.2 . 
            Each firewall is a virtual machine, which connects to the Router1 with a unique VLAN.
